                    <h1>SPARTAN</h1>
                    <p>Sparta had a reputation for the severe and highly disciplined way of life it enforced among its citizens, so as to keep them ready for war at any time. Physical training was required for both men and women. A boy would begin his military training at 7 and would live in army barracks for much of his life, even after he was married. </p>
                    <p>"spartan accommodations", some tourists jump at the chance for a refreshing change from the luxuries they've been used toâ€”and no one worries that they'll be forced out of bed at dawn to participate in war games.</p>
