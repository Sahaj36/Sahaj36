MODULE: 4 (JavaScript Basic & DOM)


1. What is JavaScript?
=> JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.
=> JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.
=> JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.

2. What is the use of isNaN function?
=> The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal 
   number or not. It returns true if the value is a NaN else returns false.

3. What is negative Infinity?
=> NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic      
   operation or mathematical function generates a negative value greater than the largest 
   representable number in JavaScript (i.e., more negative than -Number. MAX_VALUE) . 
   JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity .

4. Which company developed JavaScript?
=> JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and    
   became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the 
   Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's 
   latest version was 1.8.

5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?
=> Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any   
   value. Undefined is not a keyword. Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any 
   variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword.

6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?
=> Syntax: document. createElement("<tagName>"); // Where <tagName> can be any HTML // 
   tagName like div, ul, button, etc. // newDiv element has been created For Eg: let newDiv 
   = document. createElement("div");

7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
=> The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the 
   client's end, making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state 
   at the server's end, making it easy to manage content from this end too.

8. What is === operator?
=> The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning 
   a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always 
   considers operands of different types to be different.

9. How can the style/class of an element be changed?
=> Another way to alter the style of an element is by changing its class attribute. class   
   is a reserved word in JavaScript, so in order to access the element's class, you use 
   element. className.

10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
=> readFile() and rs. writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using  
   javascript. The file is read using the fs. readFile() function, which is an inbuilt 
   method.

11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
=>  Different Kinds of Loops :

    for/in - loops through the properties of an object. for/of - loops through the values 
    of an iterable object. while - loops through a block of code while a specified 
    condition is true. do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified 
    condition is true.

12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
=>  In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed-in string 
    parameter or value to an integer value itself. This function returns an integer of the 
    base which is specified in the second argument of the parseInt() function.

13. What is the function of the delete operator?
=>  The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an    
    object and there are no more references to the object, the object held by that property 
    is eventually released automatically.

14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
=>  JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.

15. What is the use of Void (0)?
=>  “javascript: void(0)” is similar to void. javascript: void(0) means return undefined as 
     a primitive value. We use this to prevent any negative effects on a webpage when we 
     insert some expression. For example, in the case of URL hyperlinks.

16. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript? 
=>  Approach: We can use window. location property inside the script tag to forcefully load 
    another page in Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it 
    represents the current location of the document. We can change the URL of a window by 
    accessing it.

17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
=>  Disadvantages of innerHTML :

->  Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved.
->  Replacement is done everywhere.
->  It is not possible to append innerHTML.
->  Breaks the document.
->  Used for Cross-site Scripting.
