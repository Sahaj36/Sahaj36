        Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. 
        It was formally defined as such by the <a href="../images/" target="_blank">Internet Engineering
        Task Force </a>(IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first
         proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language
          (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and <a href="">Dan Connolly</a>, which included
           an SGML <a href="#"> Document type definition</a> to define the grammar
           .<sup><a href="#">[9][10]</a></sup> The draft expired after six months, but was notable 
           for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag 
           for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of
            basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's
             competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from 
             late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.<sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup>
